# ðŸŽ“ Peer-Graded Assignment: Shiny Application and Reproducible Pitch
Course: Developing Data Products (TSC)

ðŸ“Œ The Project Overview
This project is divided into two main components:

ðŸ”¹ Part 1: Shiny Web Application
Developed using the built-in airquality dataset

Key features include:
At least one user input (e.g., slider, dropdown)
Server-side operations reacting to user input
Reactive outputs (histogram and summary statistics)
In-app documentation using helpText()
Hosted and deployed on shinyapps.io
Source code for ui.R and server.R is available on GitHub

ðŸ”¹ Part 2: Reproducible Pitch Presentation (5 Slides)
Created using RStudio Presenter (.Rpres)
Published on RPubs

Includes:
Title and overview
Description of app features
Embedded R code that runs when rendered
Presentation hosted at: http://rpubs.com/xavifu/265156

**Introduction to the Dataset**
The airquality dataset is a classic dataset in R that contains daily air quality measurements collected in New York, USA, during the months of May to September in 1973. It is commonly used in exploratory data analysis and statistical modeling.
This dataset provides insight into how environmental variables such as ozone concentration and temperature vary across the summer months and how they relate to each other.

**Dataset Description**
The dataset includes the following variables:
Variable	Description
Ozone	Ozone concentration (ppb)
Solar.R	Solar radiation (Langley units)
Wind	Wind speed (mph)
Temp	Temperature (degrees Fahrenheit)
Month	Month of measurement (numeric: 5 = May, ..., 9 = September)
Day	Day of the month

**Project Outputs**
